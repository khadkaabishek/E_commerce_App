🌟 Day 58 of Learning 🌟
Today, I implemented OAuth 2.0, a widely used method that eases authentication and authorization — powering those familiar "Login with Google" buttons you see everywhere. 🔐🌐✨

🎯 What I worked on:
1. Understood the OAuth 2.0 flow and wrote code for both backend and frontend integration.
2. Integrated OAuth 2.0 into my project successfully.
3. Encountered a minor error due to a small schema change, which I plan to fix tomorrow.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Gained practical experience implementing OAuth 2.0 end-to-end.
✔️ Integrated third-party login smoothly into my existing project.
✔️ Excited to troubleshoot and polish the implementation further.

Next up: Fix the schema-related error and ensure the OAuth login is fully stable! 🚀🔧🧠
